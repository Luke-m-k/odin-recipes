    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To prepare this delicious recipe, start by cooking lasagna noodles until al dente and set them aside. In a skillet, brown ground beef with onions and garlic until cooked through, then add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and a 
        blend of Italian herbs. In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan, and beaten eggs. To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of
        noodles and a generous spread of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers until the dish is filled, finishing with a sprinkle of mozzarella on top. Bake the lasagna in the oven until bubbly and golden, allowing the flavors to meld 
        together. Once done, let it cool slightly before serving, and enjoy the delightful combination of rich flavors and hearty textures that make lasagna a perennial favorite.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Ground beef (and/or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Canned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Italian herbs</li>
        <li>Ricotta, Shredded Mozzarella and Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to about 190 degrees Celcius.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente (firm but cooked), then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Brown the Ground beef / Italian sausage over medium heat. Add diced onions and minced garlic, and cook until the meat is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Drain excess fat from the skillet, add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and Italian herbs to the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir well and let the meat mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese (reserve a portion for the topping), grated Parmesan cheese, and beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly until well blended.</li>
        <li>Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna. Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the meat sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Spread a generous layer of the cheese mixture evenly over the noodles, covering them completely.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, cheese mixture. Continue layering until you run out of ingredients, ensuring that the top layer is the meat sauce. Sprinkle the reserved shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the initial baking time, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>    
    </ol>
